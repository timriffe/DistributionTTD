  journal = {Demographic Research},

  number = {19},
  abstract = {Since the beginning of the twentieth century, important transformations
	have occurred in the age-at-death distribution within human populations.
	We propose a flexible nonparametric smoothing approach based on P-splines
	to refine the monitoring of these changes. Using data from the Human
	Mortality Database for four low mortality countries, namely Canada
	(1921-2007), France (1920-2009), Japan (1947-2009), and the USA (1945-2007),
	we find that the general scenario of compression of mortality no
	longer describes appropriately some of the recent adult mortality
	trends recorded. Indeed, reductions in the variability of age at
	death above the mode have stopped since the early 1990s in Japan
	and since the early 2000s for Canadian, US, and French women, while
	their respective modal age at death continued to increase. These
	findings provide additional support to the shifting mortality scenario,
	using an alternative method free from any assumption on the shape
	of the age-at-death distribution.},

  pages = {505-538},
  number = {17},
  abstract = {Kannisto (2001) has shown that as the frequency distribution of ages
	at death has shifted to the right, the age distribution of deaths
	above the modal age has become more compressed. In order to further
	investigate this old-age mortality compression, we adopt the simple
	logistic model with two parameters, which is known to fit data on
	old-age mortality well (Thatcher 1999). Based on the model, we show
	that three key measures of old-age mortality (the modal age of adult
	deaths, the life expectancy at the modal age, and the standard deviation
	of ages at death above the mode) can be estimated fairly accurately
	from death rates at only two suitably chosen high ages (70 and 90
	in this study). The distribution of deaths above the modal age becomes
	compressed when the logits of death rates fall more at the lower
	age than at the higher age. Our analysis of mortality time series
	in six countries, using the logistic model, endorsed Kannistoâ€™s conclusion.
	Some possible reasons for the compression are discussed.},
